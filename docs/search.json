    "text": "Derivative for different type of input mappings\n\nFunctions of type f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} - vector in, scalar out\nSuch functions take vector (s) as input (s) and return a scalar. The mean-squared-error and cross-entropy loss functions are a couple of examples of such functions that are heavily used in neural network setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean squared error (mse) loss for regression setup\n\n\n\nSuppose you have a continuous target variable (a.k.a dependent variable) Y corresponding to a feature (a.k.a independent variable) X for a regression problem.\nLet us take N as the total number of such pairs (i.e. examples) (x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^N in our data. Now, at the end of the learning process of a neural network, we are about to get N predictions which is another set of values \\hat{y}_{i=1}^N.\nTo measure the goodness of fit of the predictions w.r.t to actual target values (y_i ’s), typically a mse loss function is used. This is defined as below:\n\nmse(y, \\hat{y}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n\nWe expect the mse value to be close to zero (or some predefined threshold depending on the use case and problem setup) to ensure the correctness of the prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncross entropy loss for classification setup\n\n\n\nConsider a binary classification problem with X as the single feature variable and Y as the class labels which can take a value as either zero or one. This is also known as a binary logistic regression problem.\nAs before, we have a total of N examples (x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^N in our data, where \\forall i, y_i \\in \\left\\{0,1\\right\\}.\nBinary classification is the simplest form of classification problem, which will help us to understand the concept easily.\nSince, Y can take only two possible values, it’s safe to consider that Y is having a bernoulli distribution.\nAlso assume,\n\\begin{align}\n  Y &= 1 \\Rightarrow \\text{success} \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{failure} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nHere we need one more quantity p as probability of having a success as part of the distribution of Y, it is an important attribute of the data that we have.\nNow, following the nature of bernoulli distribution, the probability of Y taking an outcome, can be expressed in a generic way as given below:\n\nP(Y = y) = p^y \\times (1-p)^{1-y}; \\text{where } Y \\in \\left\\{{0,1}\\right\\}\n\nNote that, putting y=1 in the above function will give you p. This function always gives a value in between zero and one. It is also known as the likelihood function given that the quantity p is unknown, but y is known.\nHaving defined the above expression, we are ready to look at the entire data. It is to be noted that each of the examples are independent of each other.\nNow, the next step is to find out the probability of having the target values themselves as y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_N at some point of time that we are considering for the classification task.\nTo be specific, we would want to know that whichever process has generated the data, what would be the probability of generating this sample again. This combined probability is called likelihood.\nSince these Y_i’s are independent of each other, this likelihood (equivalent to joint probability) of Y_1=y_1, \\dots, Y_N=y_N is just the product of the individual likelihoods i.e. \n\\begin{align}\n  P(Y_1=y_1, \\dots, Y_N=y_N) &= \\prod_{i=1}^N P(Y_i = y_i) \\nonumber \\\\\n                              &= \\prod_{i=1}^N p_i^{y_i} \\times (1-p_i)^{1-y_i} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{align}\nAt this stage, a log function is typically applied to scale the above quantity for future calculations. The log function has same pattern as the function on which it is applied to i.e. mathematically speaking,\n\n\\text{if } \\forall a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}, a &gt; b  \\Rightarrow f(a) &gt; f(b), \\text{ then } log(f(a)) &gt; log(f(b))\n\nTherefore we have, \\begin{align}\n  log\\left[P(Y_1=y_1, \\dots, Y_N=y_N)\\right] &= \\sum_{i=1}^N y_i log(p_i) + (1-y_i) log(1-p_i) \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nThe above quantity is a negative quantity as the log function returns negative values when the input is within zero and one and working with a negative quantity can be conceptually misleading. That is why it is usually multiplied by negative one to make it positive.\nThis positive quantity is often referred to as negative log likelihood (nll) and is considered as the loss function for this type of binary classification problems.\nHence, the negative log-likelihood loss function is finally expressed as,\n\nnll = -\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left\\{y_i log(p_i) + (1-y_i) log(1-p_i)\\right\\}\n\nIt should be noted that, the quantity p_i is usually estimated by the model (like a FFN for binary classification or logistic regression), whereas y_i being the true value in our data for the i^{th} sample.\nThe NLL loss function tries to measure the similarity between the distribution of the predicted values p and the distribution of actual values y (i.e. labels).\nThe cross entropy loss function is just a generalisation of this simple negative log likelihood giving the similar kind of information for a prediction when the data has, say, K labels instead of just two.\nIt is expressed as,\n\n\\text{cross entropy loss} = - \\sum_{k=1}^K y_k log(\\hat{y}_k)\n\nWhere y_k’s are true probabilities (or give the true distribution of labels), whereas \\hat{y}_k’s are predicted probabilities (or give the predicted/estimated distribution of labels).\n\n\nThe vector of gradients of such a function f is defined as below:\n\n\\frac{df}{d\\vec{x}} = \\left(\\frac{df}{dx_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{df}{dx_n}\\right)'\n\n\n\nFunctions of type f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m - vector in, vector out\nSuch functions take vector (s) as input (s) and return another vector with different dimensions as output.\nA simple example can be a function f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3:\n\ninput: \\vec{x} = \\left(x_1, x_2\\right) and a matrix of parameters \\mathbf{W}_{3 \\times 2}\noutput: \\vec{y} = f(\\vec{x}) = \\left(w_{11}x_1+w_{12}x_2, w_{21}x_1+w_{22}x_2, w_{31}x_1+w_{32}x_2\\right)\n\nIn this case, derivative of f(\\vec{x}) will be a matrix of dimension m \\times n, as given below:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{d\\vec{y}}{d\\vec{x}} &= \\left(\\frac{d\\vec{y}}{dx_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{d\\vec{y}}{dx_n}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n    &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n            \\frac{dy_1}{dx_1} & \\frac{dy_1}{dx_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{dy_1}{dx_n} \\\\\n            \\frac{dy_2}{dx_1} & \\frac{dy_2}{dx_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{dy_2}{dx_n} \\\\\n            \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n            \\frac{dy_m}{dx_1} & \\frac{dy_m}{dx_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{dy_m}{dx_n} \\\\\n        \\end{pmatrix} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nThis matrix is often referred to as jacobian matrix of \\vec{y} with respect to \\vec{x}."

    "text": "Differentiation through a graph\nNeural networks learn (i.e. update the parameters) using an iterative process where at the core it uses backpropagation algorithm to compute derivatives of a loss function w.r.t each node in the graph.\nLet us revisit the previously shown simple computational graph to understand it in a better way,\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n  a(a) --&gt; c(c = a+1)\n  a(a) --&gt; d(d = a+b)\n  b(b) --&gt; d(d = a+b)\n  c(c = a+1) --&gt; e(e = c * d)\n  d(d = a+b) --&gt; e(e = c * d)\n  e(e = c * d) --&gt; l(l = e+f)\n  f(f) --&gt; l(l = e+f)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can assume l as the loss and we want to measure the rate of change of loss w.r.t each of the nodes (including loss node itself) in the backward direction (why backward? … I will explain later).\nThis whole computation is performed in multiple steps as follows:\n\nStep 1: rate of change of l w.r.t l itself i.e. \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial l} = 1\nStep 2: rate of change of l w.r.t e i.e. \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial e} = \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial e} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial l} = \\frac{\\partial (e+f)}{\\partial e} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial l} = 1\nStep 3: rate of change of l w.r.t f i.e. \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial f} = \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial f} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial l} = \\frac{\\partial (e+f)}{\\partial f} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial l} = 1\nStep 4: rate of change of l w.r.t c i.e. \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial e}{dc} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial e} = \\frac{\\partial (c*d)}{\\partial c} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial e} = d\nStep 5: rate of change of l w.r.t d i.e. \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial d} = \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial d} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial e} = \\frac{\\partial (c*d)}{\\partial d} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial e} = c\nStep 6: rate of change of l w.r.t a i.e. \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial a}, this step can be broken into two parts as changing a, can change l either through c or through d, therefore,\n\n\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial a} = \\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial a} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial c} \\right)}_{\\text{changes through c}} + \\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial a} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial d} \\right)}_{\\text{changes through d}} = d + c\n\nStep 7: rate of change of l w.r.t b i.e. \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial b} = \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial b} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial d} = 1 \\times c = c\n\nThe real benefit of computing derivatives (a.k.a gradients) in the backward direction is that it allows the learning algorithm to compute gradients for all the nodes with a single attempt.\nIf we would have started in the forward direction, then the learning algorithm would have travelled the entire graph for each of the input nodes at the very beginning. Unlike a simple graph like the above one, this forward mode differentiation is computationally very costly for a large network.\nPytorch, being a popular deep learning toolkit, has implemented a .backward() method for their neural network class to compute the derivatives for all the nodes (technically not all, only for them with requires_grad=True) in a computational graph with a single attempt."

Strange? No problem, I will explain this assumption at the end of this section.\nNow, if we take the dot product of \\mathbf{J}^T and \\vec{v}, this is what we are going to get,\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{J}^T \\cdot \\vec{v} &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n                                \\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial y_3}{\\partial x_1} \\\\\n                                \\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial y_2}{\\partial x_2} & \\frac{\\partial y_3}{\\partial x_2} \\\\\n                              \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n                                  \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial y_1} \\\\\n                                  \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial y_2} \\\\\n                                  \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial y_3} \\\\\n                              \\end{pmatrix} \\nonumber \\\\\n                           &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n                                  \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial x_1} \\\\\n                                  \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial x_2}\n                              \\end{pmatrix} \\nonumber \\\\\n                           &= \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\vec{x}} \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\nIf we observe the dot product carefully, we will notice a series of chain rules being performed.\nTherefore, this vector-jacobian product helps us to compute the gradient of loss function w.r.t the nodes in another layer which, in reality, might be far behind the output layer in the computational graph and it does so with the help of a known gradient vector for the layer right next to it.\nThe intermediate gradient vector has been considered to be computed beforehand because while performing reverse mode differentiation, we must know the gradient of the output node before computing the gradients of the input nodes which have defined the output node itself and we have seen it here where we have started taking derivatives from the output node.\nHere \\vec{y} is the output of f(\\vec{x}), so we can safely take this assumption to understand the theory.\nNow, the next part is to compute \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}} which can again be done using,\n\n\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}} = \\frac{\\partial \\vec{y}}{\\partial \\mathbf{W}} \\times \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial \\vec{y}}\n\nHopefully, it gives us an idea to implement automatic differentiation (autograd) for a large computational graph."

    "text": "One-hot vector\nThis is the simplest way to convert tokens into a vector. One-hot vector, for a token, is a vector of dimension vocabulary_size (often denoted by |V|). In this vector, all the elements are 0’s except a single 1. The index that holds the 1 is called hot index and it is basically the index of the token in the vocabulary.\nExample:\n\none_hot_for_around = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\none_hot_for_can = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\none_hot_for_number = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAs you can imagine, for a large corpus, one-hot vectors are very large dimensional sparse vectors.\nAlso, if we represent any text using one-hot vectors (technically a matrix made of one-hot vectors), then basically we are not considering word-word relationship or similarity.\nWords (rather tokens) are considered independent chunks of the text for this kind of setup, but it is something that we do not like. Any language maintains some contexts through word-word relationships and those are completely ignored by one-hot representation.\nIf we try to measure the similarity between two words with the help of one-hot representation, we will always get zero, but that does not mean the words are very close on the semantic space."

    "section": "Embedding vector",
    "text": "Embedding vector\nAs you have observed, one-hot vectors do not consider context, so we definitely need something meaningful for representing the tokens mathematically.\nIn the world of NLP, the term embedding usually refers to a dense vector (a vector that has most of its components as non-zero real numbers) that represents a token. As you know, depending on the problem, a token can be a character, a word or even a full sentence and an embedding vector is created to represent it accordingly.\nLet us try to understand the way of expressing the meaning of words mathematically.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Word features representation\n\n\nIn the above table, we have four different words which are ‘Chocolate’, ‘Cat’, ‘Dog’ and ‘Ship’. For each of these words we have six randomly chosen features or characteristics.\nEach of the features can have values in between zero and one. If the value for a feature is very close to zero, it indicates that the feature is not very applicable to the word. Similarly, having a value closer to one indicates that the feature is quite applicable to the word.\nAs an example, the feature ‘can_play_with’ is not at all relevant to the word ‘Ship’, that’s why the score is 0.0.\nInteresting thing to note here is that the words ‘Cat’ and ‘Dog’ have very similar scores for all the features. This makes them very similar words and in reality, they do have many common characteristics too.\nIf we consider a 6D vector space (also called semantic space) based on these features, then obviously, ‘Cat’ and ‘Dog’ are going to be very close to each other over there. However, the words ‘Chocolate’ and ‘Ship’ will be far away.\nThis is how, by using vectors, we can mathematically express the meaning of words to a computer. These vectors are known as embedding vectors.\nAlthough embedding vectors are very helpful, they are very difficult to design. We do not really know how to design the features."

    "text": "Learning word embeddings\nNeural networks, as versatile tools, come here to solve the problem. Here, we will learn an algorithm, called word2vec that helps us in getting embedding vectors by using a shallow (not very deep) neural network trained on some texts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore delving into the algorithm, we must understand one simple yet very useful application of one-hot vector and matrix multiplication.\nSuppose, we have an embedding matrix (made of stacking the embedding vectors together) \\mathbf{E}^T_{4 \\times 6} just like the above figure.\nIf we consider our vocabulary as ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Chocolate', 'Ship'], then one-hot vector for the word ‘Dog’ will be \\vec{v}_{Dog} = \\left(0, 1, 0, 0\\right).\nNow, if we multiply \\vec{v}_{Dog} and \\mathbf{E}^T, then the result of \\vec{v}_{Dog} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}^T gives us the second row of \\mathbf{E}^T which is nothing but the embedding vector of the word ‘Dog’.\nTherefore, we can use an on-hot vector and extract the corresponding embedding vector from the embedding matrix. This is why embedding matrices are also called lookup tables.\n\n\nIf we consider a word in a sentence, then it is very obvious to note that the surrounding words have some relationships with it.\nAs an example, if we have a sentence like ‘the dog is swimming in the pond’, then the words swimming and pond are related.\nThe word swimming is the context here, if we know this, we can anticipate other words similar to pond as well just by following the context.\n\nContinuous bag of words (CBOW) model\nConsider an incompelte sentence: the birds are _____ in the sky. By looking at the words the, birds, are, on, the, sky, can we imagine the missing word? Ofcourse, it must be either flying or very similar to it.\nThis is exactly what happens when we use the CBOW approach. CBOW looks at the context and tries to figure out the target word as shown below,\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Predicting target word based on context\n\n\nIn reality, this context window moves towards the right till the time we have covered all possible contexts and targets starting from the beginning of our text data to the end. Don’t worry, the code example, given below, will make this easier to understand.\nWe will now consider a sample text and prepare the training data using CBOW approach for a shallow feed-forward network. It’s going to have a single hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is controlled by the dimension of the embedding vector.\nA pseudo network architecture is shown below,\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A pseudo CBOW network\n\n\nIn this network, each word in the context is fed to the network as an one-hot vector. Having the input vector, the network does some computations to form the hidden layer and eventually tries to predict the target word. The source code depicting the network architecture is given below.\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass Word2Vec(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):\n        super(Word2Vec, self).__init__()\n        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim\n        \n        # define weight matrices\n        self.weight_i2h = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(\n            (self.embedding_dim, self.vocab_size), \n            dtype=torch.float\n        ))\n        self.weight_h2o = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(\n            (self.vocab_size, self.embedding_dim), \n            dtype=torch.float\n        ))\n\n        self.params = nn.ParameterList(\n            [\n                self.weight_i2h, \n                self.weight_h2o \n            ]\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, input):\n        # create onehot vector of the input\n        input_onehot = F.one_hot(input, self.vocab_size)\n\n        # compute hidden layer\n        hidden = F.relu(\n            torch.matmul(\n                self.weight_i2h, \n                input_onehot.view(self.vocab_size, -1).float()\n            )\n        )\n\n        # compute output\n        output = torch.matmul(\n            self.weight_h2o,\n            hidden\n        )\n\n        # compute log softmax\n        log_probs = F.log_softmax(output.view(1, -1), dim=1)\n\n        return log_probs\n\nNote the output dimension of the network. It is exactly equal to the size of the vocabulary as there are that many number of possibilities while predicting the target word.\nSo, essentially, this whole process is a multi-class classification process.\nIt is strange to know that prediction is not what we actually focus on here. We are interested in the weight matrix \\mathbf{E}. This is our embedding matrix filled with optimally trained parameters.\n\\mathbf{E} has the dimension dim(\\text{embedding vector}) \\times dim(\\text{one-hot vector}).\nHence, \\vec{v}_{word_j} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}^T just gives us the embedding vector for word_j.\nLet us now see how the training data is prepared for the CBOW network from a sample text.\n\n# imports\nimport re\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\nraw_text = \"\"\"We are about to study the idea of a computational process.\nComputational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.\nAs they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data.\nThe evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules\ncalled a program.

It may not be optimised, but it will give you enough confidence to understand the whole story behind word2vec."

Now let’s assume that our null hypothesis or prior belief about that person is, the person is not guilty. If the judge’s verdict is against the accused even if the person has really not done anything wrong, then it is the Type-I error, whereas if the verdict is in favor of the accused when in reality the person has done something wrong, then it is the Type-II error. If you’d think for a moment, you would understand the fact that Type-I error is more severe in nature.\nThis one is going to be of great impotance for the society. We know that almost every country has their own military radar system to detect any missilies aimed at them. Assume that, the null hypothesis is the enemy is in war mode, they will attack. Now, could you imagine the situation, if the military radar system would have failed to detect the missiles that had been aimed at your country and they were few miles away from their target…the lives of innocent citizens would have been devastated.\n\n\n\nfig-1\n\n\n\nHaving understood the importance of Type-I error in decision making, the usual tendency of the experimenter is to keep the chance of making Type-I error fixed at a very low level, which, by years of research and experimentations, has been chosen as 1% or 5%, depending on the situation."

    "text": "Working with files and directories\nNow, you know the basics of running commands and getting some simple yet useful information, it is the time to see a bit more interesting commands.\n\n👉 Creating a file with touch\n!touch my_first_file.txt\ntouch creates a file with the name given by the user right next to it followed by a space character.\n\n\n👉 Writing data to a file using tee\n# writing date to file, the file will be created if it does not exist\n!date | tee records.txt\n\n# writing data in append mode with flag '-a'\n!date | tee -a records.txt\n\n# evaluate and then write in append mode\n!echo $(date) | tee -a records.txt\nWed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\n\nWed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\n\nWed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\nBy default, tee overwrites the data to the file, -a is used to avoid this.\nWe have one more operator (|) here, it is called pipe operator. It takes the output of the previous command and passes to the next command.\nWriting same data to multiple files is also very intuitive as in date | tee -a file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\nThe same operations can also be performed using redirect operator &gt;. date &gt; record.txt will write the system date time by overrwriting the file and date &gt;&gt; record.txt will write the data to the file in append mode.\nA file can be removed using the rm command, e.g. rm record.txt\n\n\n👉 Working with directory (folder)\n# create directory with 'mkdir'\n!mkdir test_dir_1\n!mkdir test_dir_2\n\n# create directory recussively along a path with flag '-p'\n!mkdir -p test_dir_1/sub_dir/sub_sub_dir\n\n# remove directories with 'rm'\n!rm -d test_dir_2 # '-d' flag (directory) is used to remove an empty directory\n!rm -r test_dir_1 # '-r' flag (recurive) is used to remove a directory and all of its contents\n# rm -rf test_dir_1 '-f' flag (force) is used to remove a directory and all of its contents forcefully\nmultiple directories can also be removed just by specifying their paths one by one. One very useful flag for rm command is -i, which makes the removal process interactive.\nNote: In linux, if you add a . before the file and diretory name, then it will be hidden which means simple ls command cannot show you these, you must to use ls -a to locate them 😉 .\n\n\n👉 Copying files and directories from source to destination\nTo copy a file or directory from source to destination, we have the command cp. See the examples below to understand how it works,\n\ncopy a file: cp source_path/file.txt destination_path/\ncopy a directory: cp -r source_path/test_dir/ destination_path/\n\n\n\n👉 Searching for files and directories using grep\nSometimes you may need a search for a file or directory inside the terminal. This can be done using the command called grep. It is used with ls through a pipe operator as if we are telling bash to filter the ls output by the pattern. See the examples below,\n# will only show files and directories with the word 'first' in their names \n!ls -lahts | grep first\n   0 -rw-r--r--  1 koushik koushik    0 Mar 22 17:23 my_first_file.txt\n\n\n👉 Editing a file with nano\nnano is a text editor which typically available in almost all linux based systems. It is very useful if you quickly want to edit a file without leaving the terminal.\nnano &lt;your_file_name&gt; is the command to open a file with nano. Once you are done with the editing, you can use Ctrl+S (Cmd+S in case you’re using clound from a Mac) to save the file and Ctrl+X (or Cmd+X in Mac) to close the editor.\n\n\n👉 Viewing the content of a file using cat\nIn case you want to see the content of a file, you have a command called cat. It has several flags to use based on your requirements. Be careful, when using cat for a large file, by default it will show you everything that is there in the file.\ncat records.txt\nWed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\nWed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\nWed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\nYou can use the flag -n to see the line numbers right before the lines.\ncat -n records.txt\n     1  Wed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\n     2  Wed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\n     3  Wed Mar 22 17:23:25 IST 2023\nThat’s all for the part 1. I hope you have enjoyed reading the post, stay tuned for the next part."
